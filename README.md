# Benchmarking-CMA-ES-with-Rank-One-update-Algorithm
A derivative Free Optimization Project where we Benchmarked the CMA-ES Rank 1 Using COCO Platform
---

In this Project we used the COCO platform to benchmark the CMA-ES algorithm with the Rank one Update only, using COCO we will obtain ECDF plots that tells the fraction of functions were solved with in a specific budget and then we compared performance with other algorithms the classes of functions were used to test performance were the noiseless functions avaiable on BBOB Test suite.
